nebyx csgo config 7/29/2023

download .cfg file put it in -> C:\Program files\Steam\userdata\{random numbers,u will find config files in the same folder}

after putting this .cfg to already existing cfg folder(with other configs), open game and use console command: "exec nebyxconfig" to execute my config.

happy hunting.
